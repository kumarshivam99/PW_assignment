If a variable is ordinal, it is appropriate to use measures such as median or mode, but not mean, as the ranking of the values does not necessarily correspond to equal intervals. If a variable is interval or ratio, all three measures (mean, median, and mode) can be used, as well as measures such as standard deviation and correlation.\n",

If income is measured as a nominal variable with categories such as \"less than 20,000\", \"20,000 to 40,000\", and \"more than 40,000\", it would be inappropriate to calculate the mean income, as the categories do not represent equal intervals. Instead, appropriate measures would include the frequency counts and percentages of individuals in each income category. If income is measured as a ratio variable in dollars, the mean income can be calculated and compared across different groups or time periods, and statistical tests such as t-tests or ANOVA can be used to determine whether there are significant differences in income between groups."
